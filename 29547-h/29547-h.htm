<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Andr&eacute; Dacier's <i>Po&euml;tique d'Aristote Traduite en Fran&ccedil;ois avec des
Remarques</i> was published in Paris in 1692. His translation of Horace
with critical remarks (1681-1689) had helped to establish his reputation
in both France and England. Dryden, for example, borrowed from it
extensively in his <i>Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of
Satire</i> (1693). No doubt this earlier work assured a ready reception and
a quick response to the commentary on Aristotle: how ready and how quick
is indicated by the fact that within a year of its publication in France
Congreve could count on an audience's recognizing a reference to it. In
the <i>Double Dealer</i> (II, ii) Brisk says to Lady Froth: "I presume your
ladyship has read <i>Bossu</i>?" The reply comes with the readiness of a
<i>clich&eacute;</i>: "O yes, and <i>Rapine</i> and <i>Dacier</i> upon <i>Aristotle</i> and
<i>Horace</i>." A quarter of a century later Dacier's reputation was still
great enough to allow Charles Gildon to eke out the second part of his
<i>Complete Art of Poetry</i> (1718) by translating long excerpts from the
Preface to the "admirable" Dacier's Aristotle.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> Addison ridiculed the
pedantry of Sir Timothy Tittle (a strict Aristotelian critic) who
rebuked his mistress for laughing at a play: "But Madam," says he, "you
ought not to have laughed; and I defie any one to show me a single rule
that you could laugh by.... There are such people in the world as
<i>Rapin</i>, <i>Dacier</i>, and several others, that ought to have spoiled your
mirth."<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> But the scorn is directed at the pupil, not the master, whom
Addison considered a "true critic."<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small> A work so much esteemed was
certain to be translated, and so in 1705 an English version by an
anonymous translator was published.</p>

<p>It cannot be claimed that Dacier's Aristotle introduced any new critical
theories into England. Actually it provides material for little more
than an extended footnote on the history of criticism in the Augustan
period. Dacier survived as an influence only so long as did a respect
for the rules; and he is remembered today merely as one of the
historically important interpreters&mdash;or misinterpreters&mdash;of the
<i>Poetics</i>.<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small> He was, however, the last Aristotelian formalist to affect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>English critical theory, for the course of such speculation in the next
century was largely determined by other influences. None the less, his
preface and his commentary are worth knowing because they express
certain typically neo-classical ideas about poetry, especially dramatic
poetry, which were acceptable to many men in England and France at the
end of the seventeenth century. Dacier's immediate and rather special
influence on English criticism may be observed in Thomas Rymer's
proposal to introduce the chorus into English tragedy and in the
admiration which the moralistic critics at the turn of the century felt
for his theories.</p>

<p>In the very year of its publication Rymer read with obvious approbation
Dacier's <i>Po&euml;tique d'Aristote</i>. In the preface to <i>A Short View of
Tragedy</i> (1692) he announced that "we begin to understand the Epick Poem
by means of <i>Bossu</i>; and Tragedy by Monsieur <i>Dacier</i>."<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small> That Rymer
admired Dacier's strict formalism is plain, but he was especially moved
by the French critic's argument that the chorus is <i>the</i> essential part
of true tragedy, since it is necessary both for <i>vraisemblance</i> and for
moral instruction.<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small> He therefore boldly proposed that English tragic
poets should henceforth use the chorus in the manner of the ancients,
since it is "the root and original, and ... certainly always the most
necessary part of Tragedy."<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small> Moreover he praised (as had Dacier) the
example of Racine, who had introduced the chorus into the plays that he
had written for private performance, by the young ladies of St.
Cyr&mdash;<i>Esther</i> (1689) and <i>Athalie</i> (1691). As is well known, he even
went so far as to write the synopsis of what inevitably would have been
an absurd Aeschylean tragedy on the defeat of the Armada.<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small></p>

<p>Rymer's proposal provoked a public debate, which was begun by John
Dennis, at that time an almost unknown young critic. Though <i>The
Impartial Critick</i> (1693) was directed against Rymer (who had given
grave offence to Dryden and others by his attack on Shakespeare in the
<i>Short View</i>), Dennis knew Dacier's ideas intimately, and his discussion
of the chorus in the first and the fourth dialogues, is more directly a
refutation of the French than of the English critic.<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small> This lively
treatise established whatever intimacy existed between young Dennis and
the aging Dryden.<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small></p>

<p>Though Dryden avoided any extended public argument with Rymer, he
obviously knew both the <i>Short View</i> and Dacier's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> Aristotle. In the
<i>Parallel of Poetry and Painting</i> (1695), he followed Rymer's lead in
equating Dacier, the critic of tragedy ("in his late excellent
Translation of Aristotle and his notes upon him"<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small>) with Le Bossu, the
framer of "exact rules for the Epic Poem...." But he disagreed with
Dacier's opinions on the chorus and explained away Racine's use of it on
the sensible grounds that <i>Esther</i> had not been written for public, but
for private performances which gave occasion to the young ladies of St.
Cyr "of entertaining the king with vocal music, and of commending their
voices."<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small> He also suggested the practical consideration that plays
with choruses would bankrupt any company of actors because it would be
necessary to provide a number of costumes for the additional players and
to enlarge the stage (and consequently the theater) to make room for the
choral dances.</p>

<p>Dacier's insistence that the primary function of poetry is to instruct
and that pleasure is merely an aid to that end could easily be distorted
into a crudely moralistic view of the art. Doubtless it was this that
recommended the treatise to minor critics and poets who were creating
the atmosphere out of which came Jeremy Collier's attack on contemporary
dramatists in 1698.</p>

<p>Blackmore's preface to <i>Prince Arthur</i> (1695) is a long plea for the
reformation of poetry, whose "true and genuine End is, by universal
Confession, the Instruction of our Minds and Regulation of our
Manners...." One is not surprised, when toward the end he names his
authorities, that they turn out to be Rapin, Le Bossu, Dacier (as
commentators on Aristotle and Horace) and "our own <i>excellent Critick,
Mr. Rymer</i>."<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small> W.J. who translated Le Bossu in 1695, dedicated his
work to Blackmore. In his preface he linked Blackmore and Dacier as
proponents of the thesis that poetry's "true Use and End is to instruct
and profit the world more than to delight and please it."<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small> And Jeremy
Collier himself quoted Dacier from time to time, and on one occasion
invoked his commentary on Horace, "<i>The Theater condemned as
inconsistent with Prudence and Religion</i>," as one of many answers to the
unrepentant Congreve.<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small></p>

<p>But besides starting these minor controversies Dacier's preface states
some of the typical themes of neo-Aristotelian criticism: the idea that
proper tragedy is based on a fable that imitates an "Allegorical and
Universal Action" intended "to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> Form the Manners," a view that closely
relates tragic fable to epic fable as interpreted by Le Bossu;<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small> that
modern tragedy, being concerned with individuals and their intrigues,
cannot be universal and is therefore necessarily defective; that love is
an improper subject for tragedy; that the Aristotelian <i>katharsis</i>
proposes as its end not the expulsion of passions from the soul, but the
moderation of excessive passions and the inuring of the audience to the
inevitable calamities of life, and so on. Finally, he is nowhere more
typical of French critics in his time than in his vigorous defense of
the rules, which he declares are valid because of the nature of poetry
which, being an art, must have an end, and there must necessarily be
some way to arrive at it; because of the authority of Aristotle, whose
knowledge of our passions equipped him to give rules for poetry; because
of the illustrious works from which Aristotle deduced his rules; because
of the quality of the poetry that they produce when followed; because,
since they are drawn from "the common Sentiment of Mankind," they must
be reasonable; because nothing can please that is not conformable to the
rules, "for good Sense and right Reason, is of all Countries and
places;" and finally "because they are the Laws of Nature who always
acts uniformly, reviews them incessantly, and gives them a perpetual
Existence." It is his simultaneous appeal to the authority of the
ancients, to the <i>consensus gentium</i>, to general nature, and to good
sense that makes Dacier seem to us to represent the final phase of
French neo-classical critical theory.</p>

<h2>THE PREFACE</h2>


<p><i>If I was to speak here of</i> Aristotle<i>'s Merit only, the excellence of his
Poetick Art, and the reasons I had to publish it, I need do no more than
refer the Reader to that Work, to shew the disorders into which the
Theatre is long since fallen, and to let him see that as the Injustice
of Men, gave occasion to the making of Laws; so the decay of Arts and
the Faults committed in them, oblig'd first to the making Rules, and the
renewing them. But in order to prevent the Objections of some, who scorn
to be bound to any Rules, only that of their own fancy, I think it
necessary, to prove, not only that Poetry is an Art, but that 'tis known
and its Rules so certainly those which</i> Aristotle <i>gives us, that 'tis
impossible to succeed any other way. This being prov'd, I shall examine
the two Consequences which naturally flow from thence: First, that the
Rules, and what pleases, are never contrary to one another, and that you
can never obtain the latter without the former. Secondly, That Poesie
being an Art can never be prejudicial to Mankind, and that 'twas
invented and improv'd for their advantage only.</i></p>

<p><i>To follow this Method, 'tis necessary to trace Poetry from its
Original, to shew that 'twas the Daughter of Religion, that at length
'twas vitiated, and debauch'd, and lastly, brought under the Rules of
Art, which assisted, in Correcting the defaults of Nature.</i></p>

<p><i>God touch'd with Compassion for the Misery of Men, who were obliged to
toil and labour, ordain'd Feasts to give them some rest; the offering of
Sacrifices to himself, by way of Thanksgiving, for those Blessings they
had received by his Bounty. This is a Truth which the</i> Heathens
<i>themselves acknowledged; they not only imitated these Feasts, but spake
of them as a Gift of the Gods, who having granted a time of Repose,
requir'd some tokens of their grateful remembrance.</i></p>

<p><i>The first Feasts of the Ancients were thus, They assembled at certain
times, especially in Autumn, after the gathering in their Fruits, for to
rejoyce, and to offer the choicest of them to God; and this 'tis, which
first gave birth to Poetry: For Men, who are naturally inclined to the
imitation of Musick, employ'd their Talents to sing the praises of the
God they worshipped, and to celebrate his most remarkable Actions.</i></p>

<p><i>If they had always kept to that Primitive Simplicity, all the Poesie we
should have had, would have been, only Thanksgivings, Hymns, and Songs,
as amongst the</i> Jews. <i>But 'twas very difficult, or rather impossible,
that Wisdom and Purity, should reign long in the</i> Heathen <i>Assemblies;
they soon mingl'd the Praises of Men, with those of their Gods, and came
at last, to the Licentiousness of filling their Poems with biting
Satyrs, which they sung to one another at their drunken Meetings;
Thus Poetry was entirely Corrupted, and the present scarce retains any
Mark of Religion.</i></p>

<p><i>The Poets which followed, and who were (properly speaking,) the
Philosophers and Divines of those Times, seeing the desire the People
had for those Feasts, and Shows, and impossibility of retrieving the
first Simplicity; took another way to remedy this Disorder, and making
an advantage of the Peoples Inclinations, gave them Instructions,
disguis'd under the Charmes of Pleasure, as Physicians gild and sweeten
the bitter Pills they administer to their Patients.</i></p>

<p><i>I shall not recount all the different Changes, which have happen'd in
Poetry, and by what degrees it has arrived to the Perfection, we now
find it; I have spoken of it already in my</i> Commentaries <i>on</i> Horace<i>'s</i>
Art of Poetry, <i>and shall say more in explaining, what</i> Aristotle <i>writes
in this Treatise.</i></p>

<p>Homer <i>was the first that invented, or finished, an Epick Poem, for he
found out the Unity of the Subject, the Manners, the Characters, and the
Fable. But this Poem could only affect Customes, and was not moving
enough to Correct the Passions, there wanted a Poem, which by imitating
our Actions, might work in our Spirits a more ready and sensible effect.
'Twas this, which gave occasion for</i> Tragedy, <i>and banished all Satyrs, by
this means Poetry was entirely purg'd from all the disorders its
Corruption had brought it into.</i></p>

<p><i>This is no proper place to shew, that Men who are quickly weary of
regulated Pleasures, took pains to plunge themselves again into their
former Licentiousness by the invention of</i> Comedy. <i>I shall keep my self
to</i> Tragedy, <i>which is the most noble Imitation, and principal Subject
of this Treatise, all the Parts of an Epick Poem are comprized in a</i>
Tragedy.</p>

<p><i>However short this account may be, it suffices to let you see that
Poesie is an Art, for since it has a certain End, there must necessarily
be some way to arrive there: No body doubts of this constant Truth, that
in all concerns where you may be in the right, or the wrong, there is an
Art and sure Rules to lead you to the one, and direct you, how to avoid
the other.</i></p>

<p><i>The question then is, whether the Rules of this Art are known, and
whether they are those which</i> Aristotle <i>gives us here? This question is
no less doubtful, than the former, I must also confess that this cannot
be determined, but by the unlearned; who because they are the greater
number, I shall make my Examination in their favour. To do this with
some sort of Method, there are four Things to be consider'd, who gives
the Rules, the time when he gives them; the manner in which he gives
them, and the effects they have in divers times wrought on different
People: For I believe from these four Circumstances, I can draw such
Conclusions, that the most obstinate shall not be able to gainsay.</i></p>

<p><i>He who gives these Rules, is one of the greatest Philosophers that ever
was, his Genius was large, and of vast extent, the great Discoveries he
made in all Sciences, and particularly in the Knowledge of Man, are
certain Signs, that he had a sufficient insight into our Passions, to
discover the Rules of the Art of Poetry, which is founded on them. But I
shall suspend my Judgment, and pass on to the time in which he gave
these Rules.</i></p>

<p><i>I find that he was born in the Age in which</i> Tragedy <i>first appear'd, for
he lived with the Disciples of</i> &AElig;schylus, <i>who brought it out of
Confusion; and he had the same Masters with</i> Sophocles, <i>and</i> Euripides,
<i>who carried it to its utmost Perfection: Besides he was witness of the
Opinion the most nice and knowing People of the World had of this Poem.
'Tis therefore impossible that</i> Aristotle <i>should be ignorant of the
Origine, Progress, Design and Effects of this Art; and consequently even
before I examine these Rules, I am well assur'd upon his account who
gives them, that they have all the Certainty, and Authority, that Rules
can possibly have.</i></p>

<p><i>But when I come to examine the Manner in which</i> Aristotle <i>delivers them,
I find them so evident and conformable to Nature, that I cannot but be
sensible they are true; for what does</i> Aristotle? <i>He gives not his Rules
as</i> Legisltors <i>do their Laws, without any other reason than their Wills
only; he advances nothing but what is accompanied with Reason, drawn
from the common Sentiment of Mankind, insomuch that the Men themselves
become the Rule and Measure of what he prescribes. Thus without
considering that the Rules are of almost equal Date with the Art they
Teach, or any prejudice, in favour of</i> Aristotle<i>'s Name, (for 'tis the
Work which ought to make the Name valued, and not the Name the Work) I
am forced to submit to all his Decisions, the Truth of which I am
convinc'd of in my self, and whose Certainty I discover by Reason and
Experience, which never yet deceiv'd any body.</i></p>

<p><i>To this I shall add, the Effects which these Rules have produc'd in all
Ages, on different sort of People, and I see, that as they made the
Beauty of</i> Homer<i>'s</i> Sophocles, <i>and</i> Euripides <i>Poems in</i> Greece, <i>from
which they were drawn; so four or five Hundred Years after, they adorn'd
the Poems of</i> Virgil <i>and other famous Latin Poets, and that now after Two
Thousand Years they make the best</i> Tragedies <i>we have, in which all that
pleases, only does so, as 'tis conformable to these Rules, (and that too
without our being aware of it,) and what is displeasing, is such,
because it is contrary to them, for good Sense, and right Reason, is of
all Countries and Places, the same Subjects which caus'd so many Tears
to be shed in the</i> Roman <i>Theatre, produce the same Effects in ours, and
those Things which gave distaste then, do the same now, from whence I am
convinced, that never any Laws had either so much Force, Authority, or
Might. Humane Laws expire or Change very often after the Deaths of their
Authors, because Circumstances Change, and the Interests of Men, whom
they are made to serve, are different; but these still take new vigor,
because they are the Laws of Nature, who always acts uniformly, renews
them incessantly, and gives them a perpetual Existence.</i></p>

<p><i>I won't pretend nevertheless that the Rules of this Art, are so firmly
established, that 'tis impossible to add any thing to them, for tho'</i>
Tragedy <i>has all its proper Parts, 'tis probable one of those may yet
arrive to greater Perfection. I am perswaded, that tho' we have been
able to add nothing to the Subject, or Means, yet we have added
something to the Manner, as you'l find in the Remarks, and all the new
Discoveries are so far from destroying this Establishment, that they do
nothing more than confirm it; for Nature is never contrary to herself,
and one may apply to the Art of Poetry, what</i> Hippocrates <i>says of
Physick,</i><small><a name="f17.1" id="f17.1" href="#f17">[17]</a></small> Physick is of long standing, hath sure Principles, and a
certain way by which in the Course of many Ages, an Infinity of Things
have been discovered, of which, Experience confirms the Goodness; All
that is wanting, for the perfection of this Art, will without doubt be
found out, by those Ingenious Men, who will search for it, according to
the Instructions and Rules of the Ancients, and endeavour to arrive at
what is unknown, by what is already plain: For whoever shall boast that
he has obtained this Art by rejecting the ways of the Ancients, and
taking a quite different one, deceives others, and is himself deceived;
because that's absolutely impossible. <i>This Truth extends it self to all
Arts and Sciences, 'tis no difficult matter to find a proper Example in
our Subject, there is no want of</i> Tragedies, <i>where the management is
altogether opposite to that of the Ancients. According to the Rules of</i>
Aristotle, <i>a</i> Tragedy <i>is the Imitation of an Allegorical and Universal
Action, which by the means of Terror, and Compassion, moderates and
corrects our Inclinations. But according to these new</i> Tragedies <i>'tis an
imitation of some particular Action, which affects no body, and is only
invented to amuse the Spectators, by the Plot, and unravelling a vain
Intrigue, which tends only to excite and satisfie their Curiosity, and
stir up their Passions, instead of rend'ring them calm and quiet. This
is not only not the same Art, but can be none at all, since it tends to
no good, and 'tis a pure Lye without any mixture of Truth; what
advantage can be drawn from this Falshood? In a word, 'tis not a Fable,
and by consequence, is in no wise a</i> Tragedy, <i>for a</i> Tragedy <i>cannot
subsist without a Fable,</i><small><a name="f18.1" id="f18.1" href="#f18">[18]</a></small> <i>as you will see elsewhere.</i></p>

<p><i>We come now to the first Consequence, which we draw, from what we have
Establish'd, and shall endeavour to prove, that our Laws, and what
pleases, can never be opposite, since the Rules were made only for what
pleases, and tend only to show the way you must walk in, to do so. By
this we shall destroy the false Maxim, That,</i> all that pleases is good,
<i>and assert that we ought on the contrary to say, That,</i> all that is good
pleases, or ought to please. <i>For the goodness of any Work whatsoever,
does not proceed from this, that it gives us pleasure, but the pleasure
that we have proceeds from its goodness, unless our deluded Eyes and
corrupt Imaginations mislead us, for that which causes our mistakes, is
not, where is, but what is not.</i></p>

<p><i>If the Rules, and what pleased, were things opposite, you would never
arrive at the giving pleasure, but by meer chance, which is absurd:
There must for that reason be a certain way, which leads thither, and
that way is the Rule which we ought to learn; but what is that Rule?
'Tis a Precept, which being drawn from the</i> Pleasant <i>and</i> Profitable,
<i>leads us to their source. Now what is the</i> Pleasant <i>and</i> Profitable?
<i>'Tis that which pleases naturally, in all Arts 'tis this we consult,
'tis the most sure and perfect Model we can Imitate; in it we find
perfect Unity and Order, for it self is Order, or to speak more
properly, the effect of Order, and the Rule which conducts us thither;
there is but one way to find Order, but a great many to fall into
Confusion.</i></p>

<p><i>There would be nothing bad in the World, if all that pleas'd were good;
for there is nothing so ridiculous, but what will have its Admirers. You
may say indeed, 'tis no truer, that what is good pleases, because we see
ev'ry day Disputes about the Good and Pleasant, that the same Thing
pleases some, and displeases others; nay, it pleases and displeases the
very same Persons at different times: from whence then proceeds this
difference? It comes either from an absolute Ignorance of the Rule, or
that the Passions alter it. Rightly to clear this Truth, I believe I may
lay down this Maxim, that all sensible Objects are of two sorts; some
may be judged of, by Sense independantly from Reason. I can Sense that
Impression which the animal Spirits make on the Soul, others can't be
judged of but by Reason exercised in Science, Things simply agreeable,
or disagreeable, are of the first Sort, all the World may judge alike of
these, for example the most Ignorant in Musick, perceives very well,
when a Player on the Lute strikes one String for another, because he
judges by his Sense, and that Sense is the Rule; in such occasions, we
may therefore very well say, that all that pleases is good, because that
which is Good doth please, or that which is Evil never fails to
displease; for neither the Passions, nor Ignorance dull the Senses, on
the contrary they sharpen them. 'Tis not so in Things which spring from
Reason; Passion and Ignorance act very strongly on it, and oftentimes
choak it, this is the Reason, why we ordinarily judge so ill, and
differently concerning those Things, of which, that is the Rule and the
Cause. Why, what is Bad often pleases, and that which is Good doth not
always so, 'tis not the fault of the Object, 'tis the fault of him who
judges; but what is Good will infallibly please those who can judge,
and that's sufficient. By this we may see, that a Play, that shall bring
those Things which are to be judg'd of by Reason, within the Rules, as
also what is to be judg'd of by the Sense, shall never fail to please,
for it will please both the Learned, and Ignorant: Now this Conformity
of suffrages is the most sure,</i><small><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1" href="#f19">[19]</a></small> <i>or according to</i> Aristotle <i>the only
Mark of the Good, and Pleasant, as he proves in the following part of
his Discourse. Now these Suffrages are not obtained, but by the
observation of the Rules, and consequently, these Rules are the only
Cause of the Good, and Pleasant, whether they are follow'd Methodically
and with Design, or by Hazard only; for 'tis certain, there are many
Persons who are entirely Ignorant of these Rules, and yet don't fail to
succeed in several Affairs: This is far from destroying the Rules, and
serves to shew their Beauty, and proves how far they are conformable to
Nature, since those often follow them, who know nothing of 'em. In the
Remarks you shall find many Examples of the vast difference, the
observance or neglect of the Rules make in the same Subject, and by that
be throughly convinc'd that they are the two only Causes of Good, or Bad
Works, and that there can never be any occasion, where the perfect
Harmony which is between the Rules, and what pleases, shou'd be broken.</i></p>

<p><i>'Tis true to come to the last Consequence, that Poetry is an Art,
invented for the Instruction of Mankind, and consequently must be
profitable: 'Tis a general Truth that ev'ry Art is a good Thing, because
there is none whose End is not Good: But, as it is not less true, that
Men ordinarily abuse the best Things, that which was design'd for an
wholsome Remedy, may in time become a very dangerous Poison. I declare
then that I don't speak of corrupted</i> Tragedy, <i>for 'tis not in vitious
and depraved Works, that we must look for Reason, and the intent of
Nature, but in those which are sound and perfect; I speak of Ancient</i>
Tragedy, <i>that which is conform to</i> Aristotle<i>'s Rules, and I dare say,
'tis the most profitable, and necessary of all Diversions.</i></p>

<p><i>If 'twas possible to oblige Men to follow the Precepts of the Gospel,
nothing could be more happy, they would find there true Peace, solid
Pleasure, and a Remedy for all their Infirmities, and would look on</i>
Tragedy <i>as useless and below them. How could they do otherwise than have
this opinion? since those</i> Pagans <i>who apply'd themselves to the Study of
Wisdome, consider'd it with the same Genius. They themselves own, that
could the People be always brought up in the solid Truths of Philosophy,
the Philosophers need have no recourse to Fables, to give their
Instructions: But as so much Corruption was inconsistent with such
Wisdom, they were forc'd to seek for a Remedy to the Disorders of their
Pleasures; they then invented</i> Tragedy, <i>and inspir'd them with it, not as
the best Employment Men could take up, but as a means, which was able to
correct the excess, into which they plung'd themselves at their Feasts,
and to render those amusements profitable, which Custom and their
Infirmities had made necessary, and their Corruption very dangerous.</i></p>

<p><i>Men are the same now, they were then, they have the same Passions, and
run with the same Eagerness after Pleasures. To endeavour to reclaim
them from that State, by the severity of Precepts, is attempting to put
a Bridle on an unruly Horse in the middle of his carrier, in the
mean while, there is no Medium, they run into the most criminal excess,
unless you afford them regular and sober Pleasures. 'Tis a great
Happiness that their remaining Reason inclines them to love Diversions,
where there is Order, and Shows, where Truth is to be found, and I am
perswaded, that Charity obliges us, to take advantage of this, and not
to allow too much time for Debauches, which would extinguish that Spark
of Reason, which yet shines in them. Those People are distemper'd, and</i>
Tragedy <i>is all the Remedy they are capable of receiving any advantage
from; for it is the only Recreation in which they can find the agreeable
and Profitable.</i></p>

<p>Tragedy <i>does not only represent the Punishments, which voluntary Crimes
always draw on their Authors, these are too common, and well known
Truths, and leave too much liberty to our Passions; this is the meanest
sort of</i> Tragedy: <i>But it sets forth the misfortunes which even in
voluntary Crimes, and those committed by Imprudence, draw on such as we
are, and this is perfect</i> Tragedy. <i>It instructs us to stand on our guard,
to refine and moderate our Passions, which alone occasion'd the loss of
those unfortunate ones. Thus the aspiring may learn to give bounds to
his Ambition; the Prophane to fear God; the Malicious to forget his
Wrongs; the Passionate to restrain his Anger; the Tyrant to forsake his
Violence and Injustice,</i> &amp;c. <i>Those idle and infirm Men, who are not able
to bear the Yoak of Religion, and have need of a grosser sort of
Instruction, which falls under the Senses, can never have more
profitable amusements; 'twere to be wish'd, that they would renounce all
other Pleasures, and love this only. If any shall now condemn</i> Tragedy,
<i>he must also condemn the use of Fables, which the most Holy Men have
employ'd, and God himself has vouchsaf't to make use of: For</i> Tragedy <i>is
only a Fable, and was invented as a Fable, to form the Manners, by
Instructions, disguis'd under the Allegory of an Action. He must also
condemn History; for History is much less Grave and Moral than Fable,
insomuch as 'tis particular, when a Fable is more general, and
universal, and by consequence more profitable.</i></p>

<p><i>We may say too, that the only Aim of true Politicks, is to procure to
the People Virtue, Peace and Pleasure, this Design cannot be contrary to
Religion, because we chuse none of those Pleasures which destroy Virtue,
or Peace.</i> Tragedy <i>is far from it, and endeavours only their
preservation; for 'tis the only Pleasure, which disposes Men to endure
their Passions, to a perfect Mediocrity, which contributes more to the
maintaining of Peace, and acquisition of Virtue, than any thing else; I
also believe that from this Truth, we might draw a sure Rule to judge of
those Pleasures which might be permitted, and those which ought to be
forbidden.</i></p>

<p><i>You may say,</i> Tragedy <i>is dangerous, by reason of the abuses which creep
into it. Every Thing is dangerous, and may be condemn'd at this rate,
for there is nothing so excellent where Abuses may not be committed, and
of which a bad, or good use may not be made. We must remember this
Truth, that all Arts and Sciences, by the Ignorance and Corruption of
Men, ordinarily produce false Arts, and false Sciences; but these false
Arts and false Sciences, are more opposite to what they Counterfeit than
any thing besides; for there is nothing more opposite to what is
good, than what is bad in the same Kind. If that which is false, engages
us to condemn what is true, it has gain'd its point, that's what it
would have, and having thus Triumph'd over Truth, soon puts its self
into its place, than which nothing can be more Pernicious.</i></p>

<p><i>Since</i> Tragedy <i>has no defect, but what is external, it follows from
thence, that 'tis good in its self, and consequently profitable; this
cannot be contested, and those who condemn it, condemn, not only the
most noble Diversion, but the most capable to raise the Courage, and
form the Genius, and the only one, which can refine the Passions, and
touch the most vicious and obdurate Souls. I could give many examples;
but shall content my self with relating the Story of</i> Alexander <i>of</i><small><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1" href="#f20">[20]</a></small>
Pherea: <i>This barbarous Man, having order'd the</i> Hecuba <i>of</i> Euripides
<i>to be Acted before him, found himself so affected, that he went out
before the end of the first Act, saying,</i> That he was asham'd to be seen
to weep, at the Misfortunes of <i>Hecuba</i> and <i>Polyxena,</i> when he daily
imbrud his Hands in the Blood of his Citizens; <i>he was affraid that his
Heart should be truly mollify'd, that the Spirit of Tyranny would now
leave the possession of his Breast, and that he should come a private
person out of that Theatre into which he enter'd Master. The Actor who
so sensibly touch'd him, difficultly escaped with his Life, but was
secur'd by some remains of that pity, which was the cause of his Crime.</i></p>

<p><i>A very grave Historian, makes reflection much to this purpose, and
which seems to me no indifferent one in Politicks; in speaking of the
People of</i> Arcadia, <i>he says,</i> That their Humanity, sweetness of Temper,
respect for Religion, in a word, the Purity of their Manners, and all
their Virtues proceeded chiefly from the Love they had to Musick, which
by its Melody, corrected those ill Impressions, a thick and unwholesome
Air, joyn'd to a hard, and laborious way of living, made on their Bodies
and Minds. <i>He says on the contrary,</i> That the <i>Cynethians</i> fell into all
sorts of Crimes and Impieties, because they despised the wise
Institutions of their Ancestors; and neglected this Art, which was so
much the more necessary for them, as they liv'd in the coldest and worst
place of <i>Arcadia:</i> There was scarcely any City in <i>Greece,</i> where
wickedness was so great and frequent as here. <i>If</i> Polybius <i>speaks thus of
Musick, and accuses</i> Ephorus, <i>for having spoken a thing unworthy of
himself, when he said,</i> That 'twas invented to deceive Mankind: <i>what
ought we then to say of</i> Tragedy, <i>of which Musick is only a small part;
and which is as much above it, as a Word is above an inarticulate Sound,
which signifies nothing.</i></p>

<p><i>This is what, according to my Opinion, may be truly said of</i> Tragedy,
<i>and the Mean we ought to keep. But to the end this may be justly said,
the Parts must conform themselves entirely to the Rules of Ancient</i>
Tragedy, <i>that is to say, which endeavours rather to Instruct than
Please, and regard the Agreeable, as a means only to make the Profitable
more taking; they must paint the Disorders of the Passions, and the
inevitable Mischiefs which arise from thence. 'Twas for this the</i> Greek
Tragedians <i>were so much Honour'd in their own Age, and esteemed in those
which follow'd. Their Theatre was a School, where Virtue was generally
better Taught, than in the Schools of their Philosophers, and at this
very Day, the reading their Pieces will Inspire an Hatred to Vice, and a
Love to Virtue. To Imitate them profitably, we should re-establish the</i>
Chorus, <i>which establishing the</i> veri-Similitude <i>of the</i> Tragedy, <i>gives an
Opportunity to set forth to the People, those particular Sentiments, you
would inspire them with, and to let them know, what is Vicious or
Laudable, in the Characters which are Introduc'd.</i> Mr. Racine <i>saw the
necessity of this, and cannot be sufficiently praised, for having
brought it, into his two last Pieces, which have happily reconcil'd</i>
Tragedy <i>to its greatest Enemies. Those who have seen the effects of
these</i> Chorus<i>'s, cannot but be sensible of their Advantage, and by
Consequence, must Consent to what I say in my Remarks. After Examples,
and Authorities of this Nature, I have no Reason to fear my Arguments.
But enough of this Matter, tis time to come to what respects my self,
and to give some Account of this Work.</i></p>

<p><i>I have endeavour'd to make the Translation as literal as possible,
being perswaded, that I could not do better, than to stick close to the
Words of a Man, who wrote with wonderful Exactness, and puts in nothing,
but what is to the purpose. I have nevertheless taken the Liberty
sometimes, to enlarge his Thoughts, for what was understood in his time,
by half a Word, would hardly be Intelligible now, unless some Pains was
taken to explain it.</i></p>

<p><i>A simple Translation of</i> Aristotle, <i>would be clear enough, and there
would be no need of Commentaries, if we were well Instructed in those</i>
P<i>oets, from whom he takes his Rules, but as almost all the World is
Ignorant of them, and 'tis necessary to explain by Example, what is
Obscure in the Rule. This is what I have endeavour'd to do in my
Remarks, which will seem short, if you consider the many large Volumes
which have been wrote on this little Treatise.</i></p>

<p><i>Of all the</i> Latin <i>Commentators,</i> Victorius <i>seems to me the most Wise,
Knowing, and Exact, but his Assistance is not sufficient, to give us an
Understanding of Poesie. The</i> Italian Castelvetro, <i>has a great deal of
Wit, and Knowledge, if we may call that Wit, which is only Fancy, and
bestow on much Reading the name of Knowledge. If we recollect all the
Qualities of a good Interpreter, we shall have an Idea just contrary to
that of</i> Castelvetro. <i>He knew neither the Theatre, the Passions, nor the
Characters; he understood neither</i> Aristotle<i>'s Reasons, nor his Method,
and strove rather to contradict, than explain him. On the other hand, he
is so Infatuated with the Author's of his own Country, that he forgot
how to Criticise well; he talks without Measure, like</i> Homer<i>'s</i> Thersites,
<i>and declares War to all that is fine. Indeed he has some good things,
but 'tis not worth while to spend our time in looking after them. The</i>
French <i>Art of Poetry by</i> Mesnardiere, <i>may pass for a Commentary on some
Chapters of</i> Aristotle, <i>but that Work is of little value; for besides
that Author's being no good Critick, and perpetually deceiv'd, he did
not penetrate into the Meaning of the Philosopher. The Practice of the
Theatre by the Abbot</i> D'Aubignac, <i>is infinitely better, but is rather a
Sequel and Supplement, than an Explication of</i> Aristotle; <i>on which, a
perfect Instruction in the Ancient Rules, will enable you to pass a
Judgment. The Treatise of Epick Poem by Father</i> Bossu, <i>is above all the
Moderns have done in that Kind, and is the best Commentary Extant, on
what</i> Aristotle <i>has wrote concerning that sort of Poem; none ever
penetrated deeper into the bottom of that Art, and set in a better Light</i>
(<i>according to</i> Aristotle<i>'s Rules</i>) Homer<i>'s, and</i> Virgil<i>'s Beauties, or the
Solidity, and Beauty of</i> Aristotle<i>'s Rules, by the marvellous Conduct of
those two great Poets. If he had Treated of</i> Tragedy, <i>as throughly, as
he has done of the</i> Epop&oelig;ia, <i>he had left almost nothing for me to have
done after him; but unfortunately, he omitted the most difficult, which
he could have Explain'd much better than my self, had he had spare time.
His Work however has done me great Service. I have profited by the good,
which others have Wrote, and must confess, that their Faults have been
useful to me. But after all, the most excellent Commentators on the
Poetick Art, are the Ancient Poems, and as they gave the hint to make
Rules, 'tis by them, that these ought to be Explain'd. I hope, I have
not followed such good Guides in vain. If I have wander'd, by following
them, without a true Understanding, I should be very well pleased to be
put in the right way, by any, who would advise me of my Faults, or make
them publickly known.</i></p>

<p><i>Perhaps some may Reproach me, as Mr.</i> Corneille <i>did all the precedent
Commentators.</i> They have Explain'd <i>Aristotle</i> (<i>says that great Man</i>) as
Grammarians, or Philosophers, and not as Poets; because they had more of
the Study, and Speculation, than Experience of the Theatre. The Reading
them may make us more Learned, but can give us no further Insight, how
we may succeed. <i>This Reproach is founded on this general Maxim,</i> That
every one ought to be believ'd in his own Art. <i>It seems then, that those
should not pretend to explain the Rules of Poesie, who never yet made
Poems. The Principle is true, but the Consequence is not so, for before
that is drawn, we must see to whom the Art of Poetry, and what it
produc'd, does property belong. 'Tis not Poesie it self which is
produced, for then it would have been, before it was. 'Tis Philosophy
that brought it first into play, and consequently, it belongs to
Philosophy, to give, and explain its Rules. This is so true, that</i>
Aristotle <i>made not these Rules as a Poet, but as a Philosopher: And if
he made them as such, why may they not be explain'd that way too? And as
it was not necessary to make</i> Dramatick P<i>oems, to give Rules to that Art,
so 'tis no more necessary that they should be made, to Explain those
Rules.</i></p>

<p><i>I don't know indeed, whether he who has made Pieces for the Theatre, is
so proper to explain the Rules of this Art, as he that never did, for
'twould be a Miracle if one was not biass'd by self-Love, when the other
is a dis-interested Judge, who has no other Aim, than discovering the
Truth, and making it known. Mr.</i> Corneille <i>himself may be an Example of
this. All that he would Establish in his new Discourse of</i> Dramatick
Poetry, <i>is less founded on Nature, than his own proper Interest. It
appears by his own Words, that the design he had of defending what he
had ventured on the Stage, obliged him to forsake</i> Aristotle<i>'s Rules, and
to Establish new ones, which should be more favourable to himself; we
shall see in the Remarks, whether they can bear the Test. 'Tis therefore
no ways necessary to have made Poems, to prescribe Rules for Poesie, and
yet much less to explain them. If it was so, I would say there were
none, for of all those which have given any, I knew but one that was a
Poet;</i> Horace <i>himself never made an Epick Poem or a Tragedy, but to
prescribe Rules for Poesie, as also to explain them; it is sufficient to
know the Origine, and Scope of the Art Treated of; to have examin'd
those Poems, which are the Basis and Foundation, to have made
Reflections on what is agreeable, and disagreeable, and rightly to
discover the Causes; this is the only necessary Knowledge I have
endeavour'd to acquire, and Philosophy alone can lead me thither.</i></p>

<p><i>I shall add once more, that if we make a Man more Learned, by
explaining the Rules as a Philosopher, 'tis Impossible, but he must
attain a surer Knowledge, to succeed in this Art. 'Tis true, we can't
give a</i> Genius, <i>that's not done by Art, but we can shew the Path a</i> Genius
<i>ought to Tread in, and that is the only Design of all Rules.</i></p>

<p><i>I have not made the Apology of Commentators, to praise my self, for
although I am no Poet, it does not follow that I cannot be a good
Philosopher; I leave it to the Publick, and time, to Judge of my Work,
for I will neither Court, nor slight their Favours.</i></p>

<p><i>I have spoken very freely, in what I have pass'd my Judgment on, and in
so doing, Imitated the ancient Criticks, who spared neither</i> Demosthenes,
<i>nor</i> Thucidides, <i>nor</i> Plato, <i>nor any that was Great, or Venerable in
Antiquity. A flattering Criticism would be a pleasant sort of one, when
we should seek to Applaud, and the Respect due to the Name, should check
the Censure due to the Fault. I am not so scrupulous, and if any one be
offended, I shall Answer him as</i> Dionysius Halicarnass&aelig;us <i>answered</i> Pompey
<i>the Great, who wrote to him, to complain, that he had tax'd</i> Plato <i>with
some Faults.</i> The Veneration you have for <i>Plato</i> is Just, (<i>says that
excellent Critick,</i>) but the Blame you lay on me, is not so. When any one
writes on a Subject, to shew what is Good or Bad in it, he ought to
discover, and mark very exactly all its Virtues, and Vices, for that is
a sure way to find out the Truth, which is more valuable than all things
else whatever. If I had written against <i>Plato</i> with a Design to Decry
his Works, I should be as Impious as<small><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1" href="#f21">[21]</a></small> <i>Zoilus</i>, but on the contrary, I
would praise him, and if in doing so I have Improved any of his Defects,
I have done nothing worthy of Complaint, and which was not necessary for my Design.
<i>Notwithstanding this, I have put some Bounds
to this Liberty, and if I have discovered some Faults, I have conceal'd
some others, that seem'd to me not so considerable. I had respect in
them, to the Approbation of many Persons of Merit, for I would not run
Counter to an almost Universal Consent, which always is of great Weight,
and ought at least to oblige us to be cautious. But that I might give to
those Persons, an Opportunity of recollecting themselves, I have
endeavoured to explain the Rule, in such a manner, that they may
perceive those very Faults, if they will Read the Remarks with
attention. As for the rest, I had no design to offend any Body; if there
are some things which make them uneasie, 'tis impossible to write any
Work of this nature, without disgusting some. 'Tis also the Mark of good
Criticism, as well as good Philosophy. From hence it proceeded, that</i>
Plato  <i>was blamed for having taught his Philosophy a long time, without
displeasing any one Person; and they pretended by that, to say that
either his Doctrine was not good, or his Method defective, since none
had by Hearing him been made sensible of that Uneasiness, which People
naturally have, when they perceive themselves to be Vitious.</i></p>

<p><i>It would be unjust to finish this Preface, without saying something of</i>
Aristotle<i>'s Life, that those who read his Work, may know something of
him. He was the Son of</i> Nicomachus, <i>Physician of</i><small><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></small> Amyntas, <i>and
descended from</i> Esculapius. <i>His Mother was the Daughter of one of the
Descendants of those, who Transplanted a Colony, from</i> Chalcis <i>to</i>
Stagira, <i>in</i> Macedonia; <i>that is to say, she was of Noble Extraction, on
both sides. He was born at</i> Stagira, <i>about four Hundred Years, before our
Saviour. At Eighteen Years of Age, he went to</i> Athens, <i>and abode with</i>
Plato, <i>he pass'd twenty Years in his School, and when his Master was
dead, he went to</i> Hermeas <i>the Tyrant of</i> Atarna, <i>a City of</i> Mysia; <i>he went
from thence to</i> Mytelene, <i>from whence he was call'd by</i> Philip, <i>to be his
Son</i> Alexander<i>'s Tutor; he was eight Years, with that Young Prince, and
after</i> Philip<i>'s Death, returned to</i> Athens, <i>where he Taught, in the</i> Lyceum
<i>twelve Years, till the Death of</i> Alexander. <i>For</i> Antipater <i>having carried
the War into</i> Greece, Aristotle, <i>who fancied, the</i> Athenians <i>suspected
him, by reason of the strict Friendship, which was between him, and the
Viceroy of</i> Macedonia, <i>retir'd to</i> Calchis, <i>where he died soon after, by a
Fit of Sickness in the sixty third Year of his Age. He left one Son, and
one Daughter, both Young, and made</i> Antipater <i>Executor of his Will, and
Administrator of all his Goods, which were very considerable, if we may judge of them
by</i> Alexander<i>'s Liberality, who gave him eight Hundred Talents, for his
History of Animals, that is according to the lesser Talent, one hundred
and forty Thousand Pounds Sterling, or according to the greater, one
Hundred eighty six Thousand, six Hundred, sixty five Pounds, thirteen
Shillings and four Pence. The most precious of his Moveables was his
Library, which was afterwards Sold to</i> Ptolomy Philadelphus, <i>and which he
had Enrich'd with four Hundred Volumes, of his own making. In those of
his Writings which now remain, and are happily a considerable Number, we
find a very discerning Spirit, a solid Judgment, a wonderful Method,
prodigious Knowledge, and an Eloquence both strong and sweet. He himself
found out more, than the most Knowing now, learn with a great deal of
Labour and Pains, and as for those things which depended on the Vivacity
of the Spirit, no Man ever carried his Knowledge further, or Establish'd
more sure, or extensive Principles. In Dialecticks, Logick, Rhetorick,
Politicks, and Morality, we have little but what he taught us.</i></p>

<p><i>By making a proper use of his Informations, there have appear'd Works
in some of these Sciences, preferable to his, but his Rhetorick is the
most Preferable we as yet have. His Art of Poetry is more to be admir'd,
for in his Rhetorick, he made use of the Precepts of those, who Wrote
before him. But he is the first that discovered the Grounds, and Secrets
of Poesie, and none since have undertaken to Write, but in Explication
of his Thoughts, which have serv'd, and will always serve as the Rule.
He alone has Reviv'd</i> Tragedy <i>more than once.</i></p>

<p><i>In effect after it was brought to its Perfection, under the Reign of</i>
Alexander, <i>the Son of</i> Amyntas, <i>under the Reigns of</i> Perdiccas, <i>and</i>
Archelaus, <i>and degenerated in those which follow'd, but under that of</i>
Philip, <i>and</i> Alexander, <i>the Poets being Encourag'd by those Glorious
Princes, and guided by</i> Aristotle<i>'s Genius, made it flourish as before.</i></p>

<p><i>After the Death of</i> Alexander, <i>it began to Languish, and never recover'd
its entire Strength till the Reign of</i> Augustus, <i>in which the Rules of
this Philosopher were Reviv'd.</i></p>

<p><i>Since the</i> Death of Augustus, <i>it has grown Feeble, for more than sixteen
Hundred Years, till in this last Age 'twas recover'd out of its long
Decay, by Mr.</i> Corneille, <i>and Mr.</i> Racine, <i>who upheld themselves by</i>
Aristotle<i>'s Rules. So true is it, that Time is the Faithful Guardian,
not only of Great Men, as</i> Pindar <i>saith, but also of the Liberal Arts,
which it revives as occasion offers, and always, under the greatest
Princes. For what a good Soil and Air, are to Seeds and Fruits, such is
the Glory, Grandeur, Magnificence, and Liberality of Princes, to
Arts, and Sciences, which do not so much flourish under them, as by
them; and we may very properly apply to this Subject the fallowing Verse
of</i> Agathon.</p>

<div class="poem">Art favours Fortune, Fortune favours Art.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>If</i> Tragedy <i>shall some time hence suffer any sort of Eclipse, 'twill be
by the Laziness, and Haste of those Poets, who Write without being
rightly Instructed.</i> Plato <i>in his</i> Phedrus <i>Introduces a young Poet seeking</i>
Sophocles <i>and</i> Euripides, <i>and Accosting them thus.</i> I can make Verses
tolerably well; and I know how in my Descriptions to extend a mean
Subject, and Contract a great one: I know how to excite Terror, and
Compassion, and to make pitiful things appear Dreadful and Menacing. I
will therefore go, and write <i>Tragedies</i>. <i>Sophocles</i> and <i>Euripides
answer'd him</i>, Don't go so fast, <i>Tragedy</i> is not what you take it to
be; 'tis a Body, composed of many different, and well-suited Parts, of
which you will make a Monster, unless you know how to adjust them; you
may know what is to be learn'd, before the Study of the Art of Tragedy;
but you don't yet know that Art.</p>

<p><i>If there are Poets now, which don't know so much as the Young Man, of
whom</i> Plato <i>speaks, these Rules can be of no Advantage to them; but those
who are like him, and in the same Circumstances, need only keep to these
Rules, which will teach them what they are Ignorant of, and the
fourth time restore</i> Tragedy <i>to its first Lustre and Brightness. This is
the most profitable Present, can be made them, if by Meditation and
Practice they will endeavour to make a right use of it; for Precepts
alone are not sufficient to make us Learned, the Advantage, and Profit
of any Rules, depend on our Labour and Pains. If these Rules are not for
them, they will be against them, and their Works shall be Judg'd by
them.</i></p>

<p><i>Sig.</i> [A 3], <i>recto</i>, 11. 17-18. "<i>Horace's Art of Poetry.</i>" Published,
Paris, 1689, in Vol. X of Dacier's <i>Remarques Critiques sur les Oeuvres</i>
[<i>d'Horace</i>] <i>Avec une Nouvelle Traduction</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sig.</i> [A 5], <i>verso</i>, 1.2, note. "Chap. 18, Rem. 8." In this remark,
Dacier explicates Aristotle's injunction that the poet should sketch the
general outline of the fable before filling in episodes and naming
characters, thus making it general and universal.</p>

<p><i>Sig.</i> [A 6], <i>verso</i>, 1.7, note. "Chap. 13, Rem. 25." Dacier says in
this remark that a regular tragedy submitted to the judgment of the
learned and the ignorant will always please best, "<i>car l'un remarque
une chose, l'autre une autre, &amp; tous ensemble ils remarquent tout</i>."</p>

<p><i>Sig.</i> [A 8], <i>recto</i>, 1.7. "History is much less grave." "Ch. IX, Rem.
5" (Dacier's note) Dacier adds nothing to the traditional discussion of
the superiority of poetry to history and philosophy.</p>
